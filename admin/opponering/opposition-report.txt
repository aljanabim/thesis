Opposition report*

Comment to the student: Master’s projects vary considerably. If a question does not feel to be relevant to the project your are opposing, try to rephrase it. You may also introduce one or two additional questions. Answer the questions in the Opponent Record in relative detail. Answers such as yes and good are insufficient.
